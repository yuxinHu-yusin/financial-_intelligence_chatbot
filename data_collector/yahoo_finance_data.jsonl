We will see more coupons, more incentives, and more gimmicks than we've ever seen before. So I'm concerned about the margins at the end of December and more importantly, at the end of January when most of these retailers close their books.\" She attributes the increased competition among retailers to tariffs which have raised prices on some items and may leave retailers with more inventory than desired.While shoppers hunt for the best deals, they are also relying more on AI to help them find them and are also using \"buy now, pay later\" services which hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday.Even though some consumers took on short-term debt while shopping for gifts this year, analysts noted that shoppers remained savvy and watched price tags carefully to avoid impulse buys.", "metadata": {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "ticker": "ADBE", "category": "Stock News", "date": "2025-12-02", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-online-sales-surge-during-193238354.html?.tsrc=rss", "type": "stock_news"}}

And I think it’s because even though we’re getting a lot of crosscurrents in the employment data, when you take a step back, the mosaic that emerges is that the labor market is indeed weakening. And I think the Fed is pretty laser focused on maintaining full employment without overheating the job market.”Markets are now pricing in an 87% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.Stocks on the move Thursday included Amazon, which dragged on the S&P 500 with shares falling nearly one and a half percent.Shares of Salesforce climbed more than three and a half percent after the company raised its revenue and profit forecasts, anticipating demand for its artificial intelligence agent platform.And shares of Kroger fell more than four and a half percent after the supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates.", "metadata": {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "ticker": "ADP", "category": "Stock News", "date": "2025-12-04", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/p-500-ekes-slight-gain-232845864.html?.tsrc=rss", "type": "stock_news"}}

STORY: The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week fell to its lowest level in more than three years, potentially giving the Federal Reserve a reason to hold interest rates steady when it meets next week.A report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell by 27,000 last week, coming in well below economists’ expectations and painting a more robust picture of labor market conditions than other recent data.A day earlier, for instance, a report from private payroll processor ADP showed employers unexpectedly cut jobs in November, while economists had been expecting job gains.The ADP report pushed traders to price in about a 90% chance of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its policy meeting next week. But Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond, gives little credence to the ADP numbers.\"The reason that ADP is being used is because we don't have the nonfarm payroll number, which is sort of the benchmark that everybody, including the Federal Reserve, uses to gauge the strength in the labor market. So ADP has kind of filled the gap. The problem with ADP is that it's a very noisy indicator. The reach of its survey data, the way that it collects it, the way it analyzes it is not nearly as comprehensive as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it's sort of a poor substitute.\"The closely watched nonfarm payrolls report for November, originally due on Friday, has been delayed because of the more than month-long government shutdown and will now be published on December 16 - after next week's Fed meeting.As many as five of the 12 voting policymakers on the central bank's rate-setting committee have voiced opposition to or skepticism about cutting rates further, while a core of three members of the Washington-based Board of Governors wants rates to fall.", "metadata": {"source": "Yahoo Finance", "ticker": "ADP", "category": "Stock News", "date": "2025-12-04", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-192759340.html?.tsrc=rss", "type": "stock_news"}}
